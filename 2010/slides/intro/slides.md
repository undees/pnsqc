* Why We’re Here
* Document Misfits
* The Magazine Metaphor
* How to Get There
* A Few Tools

.notes Instead, I’ll begin with the story of how this talk came to be, and
then we’ll get into some horror stories of documents gone awry.  Next
we’ll talk about some ways to trick ourselves into doing the right
thing.  Finally, I’ll mention a few tools that have worked for me,
though please understand that you should use the tools that work for
you—which may be a completely different set.
