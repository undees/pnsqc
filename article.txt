Document Your Software Project
==============================

``Welcome to the team. Here are a couple of bugs you can fix to learn
your way around the system. Here's the subsystem where you'll probably
want to start looking.''

Have you heard this before? Perhaps it was followed by a wild goose
chase through the code, as you strove to read the mind of the coder
before you and decipher the purpose of each function.

Or perhaps it turned out differently. You may have opened the project
folder to find a welcome mat of sorts. Someone may have carefully laid
out a README file giving a quick overview of the directory structure,
names of functions to look at first, and even code samples hinting at
how to use or extend the code. Maybe that someone was you, several
years ago.

How Documentation Goes Wrong

What kinds of problems do developers run into when we try to come up
to speed on an existing project? Specifically, in what ways does the
documentation get in the way of our understanding of the code base?
