# Keep It With the Code #

.notes So how might those aspects of magazine articles apply to
library documentation?  One thing we can do is keep a README and a few
working examples right there in the source code.  It’s easier for
newcomers to find it, and it’s easier to remember to keep it up to
date.

# Keep It Up To Date #

.notes Speaking of keeping it up to date, you might even add compiling
and running the examples as part of your build.  Test-driven
development meets a README!

# Provide a Path #
## from “Hello World” to Mastery ##

.notes New users of your library will ask, “What’s the Hello
World equivalent for this system?”  Once they’ve got that down,
they’re likely to want to know where to go next.  This is where you
can lead them from the README to other resources like API references,
wiki pages, and so on.

# Use Tools That Fit Your Hand #

.notes As Tim Lister pointed out in this morning’s talk, you don’t
need a process or system to motivate people to do something they
already find fun.  Granted, some codebases will never be a carnival
ride, but we can at least choose tools that won’t become an excuse for
us no to write.
