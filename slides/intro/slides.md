.notes Hi, I'm Ian.  I'm here to talk about software documentation,
with an emphasis on library documentation.

.notes The problem with a title like this is that it's something
everyone says we should do.  My co-worker Tim calls these kinds of
goals "motherhood and apple pie."  So how can we get past a general
feel-good sentiment and arrive at something practical?

.notes One thing that won't work is swooping in as a self-proclaimed
expert, with no stakes in the game, and telling everyone what they
should be doing.  That'd be like picking a fight between two
strangers.  It'd be much better to start with some real stories, and
figure out if any general principles fall out from them.

* Why We're Here
* Document Misfits
* The Magazine Metaphor
* How to Get There
* A Few Tools

.notes So I'll begin with the story of how this talk came to be, and
then we'll get into some horror stories of documents gone awry.  Then
we'll talk about some ways to trick ourselves into doing the right
thing.  Finally, I'll mention a few tools that have worked for me,
though please understand that you should use the tools that work for
you--which may be a completely different set.
