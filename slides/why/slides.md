# PNSQC #

.notes It took me a few years to work up the nerve to submit a talk.
You guys are friends, neighbors, and in all cases people I really look
up to.  So it took me a few years to work up the nerve to submit a
talk.  But with this year's topic, I felt like I had something to say.

# Achieving Quality in a Complex Environment #

.notes The theme of the conference this year is Achieving Quality in a
Complex Environment.  What associations does that trigger?  Maybe
something about testing?  That'd be doable if I'd spent the year doing
a peer-reviewed effectiveness study instead of jumping feet-first into
a new codebase.  Besides, testing is already well-covered here.

# The New Guy #

.notes Let's back up a second.  "Feet-first into a new codebase."
There's a topic full of good material.  I joined a new team at work a
couple of years ago, making me the new guy, or at least one of 'em.
Has anyone here joined a new project or team recently?  What was it
that helped you get oriented?

# Cultural Knowledge #

.notes For me, it was learning bits of cultural knowledge that helped
the most.  Not just coding standards or how to perform common tasks,
but a real feel for how we do things here.  Like any long-lived group
of collaborators, my teammates had a rich oral storytelling
tradition.

# Documentation #

.notes What was new to me was the bias toward preserving and
documenting those stories.  There's a real emphasis on doing the
legwork to find out how a system works ("Ask Lance where to
start,...") and then make sure that others benefit from your detective
work ("... then add it to the docs.")

* Culture
* Artifact
* Subsystem

.notes That kind of knowledge preservation wasn't just done at the
team level.  There were, of course, stashes of documentation for
specific projects: architecture diagrams and so on.  What I really
want to talk about today, though, is even narrower: the scope of a
single subsystem or software library.

# Software Spelunking #

.notes Does anyone go software spelunking?  Browsing through random
directories you can find on the server "What's this do?"  What'd you
find?
